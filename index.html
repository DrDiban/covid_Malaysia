				<p id='writetext'>According to <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 2</span>, men are almost <strong>twice likely to die</strong> from Covid-19 than women. This finding
				tallies with a study conducted by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0247.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20largest%20body,fatality%20ratio%20is%20approximately%202.4">
				Griffith et al.</a> [1] whom reported <strong>more men died</strong> from Covid-19 in 41 out of 47 countries
				even though there was no apparent sex differences exist in the number of confirmed cases. The authors attribute this
				to <strong>three factors</strong>:</p> 

				<ol>
  					<li>Biological factors</li>
  					<li>Psychosocial factors</li>
  					<li>Behavioral factors</li>
				</ol> 

				<p id='writetext'> For the first factor, <strong>inheritance of X-chromosome by the women</strong> which contains a high density of immune-related genes
				make them mount stronger immune responses than men [<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32373791/'>2</a>]. Besides, <strong>female sex hormones</strong>, including estrogen, progesterone, and androgens was found 
				affecting the outcomes of viral infections positively. Studies by <a href='https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/19/1818/5834646'>Oudit and Pfeffer</a> [3] 
				has shown <strong>men have higher plasma <cite>angiotensin-converting 
				enzyme 2</cite> (ACE2)</strong> levels than women. This impact men negatively since severe acute <cite> respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</cite> (SARS‐CoV‐2) uses the 
				SARS‐CoV receptor ACE2 for entry into the host cell [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20926566/">4</a>]. Thus, men are susceptible for higher tissue expression of the ACE2 receptor for SARS‐CoV infections
				or the consequences of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

				</div>

				<p id='writetext'>Concerning psychosocial factor, <strong>men tend to view Covid-19 as less harmful</strong> to them than woman [<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/295505/coronavirus-worries-surge.aspx">5</a>]. 
				These downplay of consequences make them more inclined to join large gatherings or avoiding close physical contact with others [<a href="https://genderpolicyreport.umn.edu/gender-masculinity-and-covid-19"</a>6,
				<a href="https://www.menshealthforum.org.uk/news/our-own-fault-men-and-covid-19">7</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/uk/covid-19-death-low-skilled-job-intl-scli-gbr/index.html">8</a>]. 
				In addition, men behavioural pattern that includes <strong>higher rates of tobacco use and alcohol consumption</strong> increases their mortality rate due to 
				Covid-19 comorbidity diseases related to these activities [6, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32563357/">9</a>, 10, 11]. Men also tend to have <strong>lower rates</strong> than women of <strong>practising infection prevention 
				behavioural</strong> which includes handwashing, social distancing, and wearing masks [6, 9, 10, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283124">12</a>]. </p>

				From <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 3</span>, it can be seen that <strong>high blood pressure is the most frequent comorbidity</strong> found in the deceased 
				representing <strong>33.7% </strong>followed by diabetes (25.6%), chronic kidney disease (12.2%), heart disease (11.2%), stroke (5.8%) and others (11.5%). </p>

				<p id='writetext'><span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 4</span> shows the number of Covid-19 related comorbidities the deceased had. <strong>84% </strong>of the deceased had at least <strong>one or more

				<p id='writetext'><span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 5</span> shows the number of days from the date when Covid-19 was first detected on the patient to the date when the 
				patient died. As seen from the figure, most deaths occurred between <strong>0-9 days</strong> which represents <strong>66% of the deaths</strong> and this number grows to
				<strong>87%</strong> if <strong>0-19 days</strong> were considered. <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 6</span> zoom in further on the period between 0-9 days. As seen from <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 6</span>, most deaths
				occurred <strong>one day</strong> after Covid-19 was detected which represents <strong>almost a quarter (24%)</strong> of the total deaths.</p>

				<p id='writetext'><span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 7</span> shows how Covid-19 deaths are distributed by the day. Based

				<br>

				     <p id='writetext'; class="tab1">H<sub>o</sub>: There is an equal probability that death can occur on any day.</p>
				
				     <p id='writetext'; class="tab1">H<sub>a</sub>: There is not an equal probability that death can occur on any day.</p>

				</p>

				<p id='writetext'>The Chi-square results in a <strong>p-value smaller than 0.05 but larger than 0.01</strong>. Thus, at <strong>95% confidence
				interval, the null hypothesis is rejected</strong> and the alternative hypothesis whereby there is not an equal probability that death can occur on any day
				is accepted. </p>

				

				<img class="img-responsive center-block test" src="images/Deaths_by_day.png">
				

				<p id='writetext'><span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 8</span> shows the number of deaths according to the states in Malaysia.
				Note that, location data for five deaths that occurred in 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2021 are not available from MOH. This location
				is estimated by the frequency of death that occcured on states 7 days prior and 7 days ahead of the missing date data. According to <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 8</span>,
				<strong>Sabah (412) recorded the highest number of deaths</strong> followed by Selangor (369), Sarawak (137), Kuala Lumpur (125), Johor (110), and the rest (227).</p>  
				 
				<img class="img-responsive center-block test" src="images/Deaths_by_states.png">


				<p id='writetext'>The number of Covid-19 cases and the number of deaths have a <strong>strong linear correlation</strong> as can be seen from <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 9</span>. Based on
				the data, the relationship between the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths has a <strong>Pearson correlation score of 0.87</strong>, which indicates a strong correlation. 
				<strong>Sabah is a peculiar state</strong> whereby the number of deaths is way higher compared to the positive Covid-19 cases registered in their state. If Sabah was removed 
				from the dataset, the <strong>Pearson correlation scores move close to 1 (0.97)</strong> which indicates that Sabah deaths to case ratio do not tally with the rest
				of the states in Malaysia.</p>

				<img class="img-responsive center-block test" src="images/Cases_vs_deaths.png">
				

				<p id='writetext'>The impact of population density on the number of deaths per 100,000 cases is investigated. The corresponding plot is shown in 
				<span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 10</span>. Visible inspection clearly shows that there is no correlation between these two criteria
				and the <strong>Pearson correlation score of close to 0 (-0.09)</strong> support this claim. This finding may be at odd against the common conception that highly
				densely populated places should result in more Covid-19 deaths. However, many other researchers found that this may not be the case. <a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1777891'>Hamidi et al</a> [18].
				from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health claim that apart from metropolitan areas, death rate is found to be <strong>inversely proportional to population density</strong> in the USA.
				The authors attributed this inverse mortality relation to the availability of better healthcare systems at higher density locations. 
				A very recent study by the <a href='https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/13440/urban-density-and-covid-19'>Carozzi et al.</a>[19] from the London school of economics and Institute of Labour Economics, based on urban Covid-19 cases in the USA, 
				found that the <strong>denser populated region tends to experience earlier breakout</strong> than less densely populated region. 
				However, both Covid-19 infection and <strong>death rates are unrelated to urban population density</strong>.</p>
				  

				<img class="img-responsive center-block test" src="images/Deaths_vs_density.png">



				<p id='writetext'>Next, the socio-economic impact on the mortality rate is investigated. The monthly median income for each state is obtained

				<p id='writetext'> Based on the data presented in <span class='Fig_Table'>Table 3</span>, the age distribution (fraction) between
				Sabah and the rest of the states in Malaysia is <strong>very similar</strong> based on <strong>the Pearson correlation score of 0.97</strong>. Besides, the Manhattan
				distance between these two criteria is equal to 7.7 which indicates the age distribution is not far apart. The <strong>most significant information</strong>
				that is obtained from <span class='Fig_Table'>Table 3</span> is that <strong>Sabah has a younger population</strong> than the rest of the states in Malaysia.
				<strong>76.2% of the Sabah population</strong> is between the age of <strong>0-39 years old</strong>, while only <strong>67.1% population</strong> for the <strong>rest of the states in Malaysia</strong>
				fall in this category. Thus, it is <strong>safe to reject the hypothesis</strong> that Sabah high deaths to Covid-19 ratio are due to population distribution 
				that is largely concentrated on older age.</p>

				<p id='writetext'> The second hypothesis that can be proposed is that <strong>Sabah have a population that is less healthy</strong> than the rest 
				of the state in Malaysia. As mentioned earlier <strong>84% of deceased</strong> has at least </strong>one or more Covid-19 comorbidities</strong>. In order,
				to validate this hypothesis, data from <a href='https://www.moh.gov.my/moh/penerbitan/MYHAAG2018.pdf'>Malaysian Health at Glance</a> [23] report by MOH is examined.
				Based on <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 12</span>, <strong> Sabah has a morbidity rate</strong>  due to tracer conditions for hypertension
				and diabetes <strong> lower than the national average</strong>. Note that these two diseases were the top two comorbidities associated with Covid-19 deaths (<span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 3</span>).
				While the third most frequent comorbidities associated to Covid-19 deaths i.e. chronic kidney disease (<span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 3</span>) is caused by 
				diabetes and high blood pressure according with <a href='https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/about-chronic-kidney-disease#:~:text=The%20two%20main%20causes%20of,blood%20vessels%2C%20nerves%20and%20eyes.'>
				National Kidney Foundation</a>. Thus, there is <strong> no enough evidence to support the hypothesis</strong> that Sabah high deaths in Covid-19 cases are due to their population being less healtier
				than the rest of the states in Malaysia. </p>

				<p id='writetext'>The third probable hypothesis is that the <strong>Sabah Covid-19 positive cases are under-reported</strong>. To validate this
				claim, the Covid-19 positive rate shown in <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 13</span> is examined [<a href='https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing'>24</a>]. According to criteria published by WHO, in May 2020, <strong>a positive rate of less than 5%</strong> is one indicator 
				that the <strong>Covid-19 epidemic is under control</strong> in a country [24]. A rise in the positive rate is an indication that the virus is <strong>spreading
				faster than the growth that is seen in confirmed cases</strong> [24]. As shown in <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 13</span>, the <strong>positive rate in Malaysia exceeds the 5%
				threshold around November 2020</strong>. </p>

				<p id='writetext'>Coincidentally, this was the time when Sabah was experiencing its worst outbreak as shown
				in <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 14</span>.Thus, a lot of Covid-19 cases <strong>likely goes unreported during this period</strong> and the actual number of cases for <strong>Sabah should be more than 100,000</strong>

				<p id='writetext'> In order to predict the number of cases more accurately, the mobility of Malaysian is used as exogenous variables in time series analysis.
				This mobility data is obtained from <strong>‘COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports’</strong> by Google [<a href='https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/'>25</a>] who collected extensive anonymised mobile 
				device GPS user data and estimates the <strong>percentage change in activity in certain categories</strong> by country, states and day. For this study, two categories i.e. <strong>‘places of work’</strong> and <strong>‘retail & recreation’</strong> (including restaurants, cafes, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theatres)
				will be used. <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 16</span> shows the plot of these two categories. </p>

				<img class="img-responsive center-block test" src="images/Mobility.png">
				
				<p id='writetext'> Note that in <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 16</span>, the dashed line represents Malaysia government lockdowns dates to curb the pandemic situation. In total, <strong>three types of lockdowns</strong> applicable to the whole nation i.e. <strong>movement control order (MCO), 
				conditional movement control order (CMCO) and recovery movement control order (RMCO)</strong> with the order of severity on the restriction movement decreases from MCO, CMCO and RMCO. From <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 16</span>, there are instances where the workplace (blue line) mobility decreases severely without any change in 
				lockdown condition. These are due to <strong>public holidays</strong>. The impact of public holidays however does not necessarily decrease the mobility in retail and recreational (green line) unlike for workplace mobility. 
				From <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 16</span>, it can also be noticed that there is a small <strong>cyclic behaviour in both categories</strong> with prevalence in the workplace. This behavioural is due to the 
				<strong>change in the level of activities</strong> that occur throughout each week. For the workplace, Monday normally shows the highest percentage of mobility and then starts decreasing through the week until Sunday which represents the 
				lowest mobility percentage. For retail and recreational, Sunday or Monday has the highest peak and mobility starts declining until Saturday. In order to flatten these peaks and troughs, the <strong>values are averaged for 31 days</strong> for time series analysis.</p>
				
				
				<p id='writetext'>Differencing approach is applied on the daily cases values in order to convert the data into a stationary time series. Next, Dicky-Fuller test was carried out to  
				confirm the new transformed data stastifiy stationarity condition. The resulting calculation <strong>(see below)</strong>

				<p id='writetext'> From <span class='Fig_Table'>Table 5</span>, <strong>ARMA model 4,7</strong> has the highest Log likelihood and lowest AIC values 
				compared to the rest of the models. Thus, this model residual will be examined further to determine whether it is a good fit.


				First, the Dicky-Fuller test show the significance level of the residual is 0, thus it is stationary. </p>

				<p id='writetext'>Second, the residual values are checked for autocorrelation as shown <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 19</span>. All lags show ACF values below 
				significance level apart from <strong>lags 24 and 31 </strong>. However, since these values are far down the line, the model prediction is expected not to be affected
				significantlly.</p>

				

				<p id='writetext'>The residuals shown in <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 20</span> are plotted to check whether it resembles white noise. As seen
				from the figure, there is no clear pattern exist, thus the residuals represent white noise. However, it can be
				noticed that there were large peaks in June and in September 2020 due to the model inability to adapt 
				to sudden large changes quickly.</p>

				<p id='writetext'> <span class='Fig_Table'>Figure 21</span> shows how the model fits against the data. The green line represents the predictions, while the blue line
